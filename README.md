# Insurance Charges

The core of our application was a data science taks found on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/simranjain17/insurance

The dataset insurance.csv contains the following data about a person (age, gender, children, bmi, smoker, region and insurance charges).

From the dataset, regression models were applied in order to predict insurance charges. You can check the Machine Learning models applied for prediction in the insurance_expenses.ipynb file.

Inside the backend folder, open artifact folder and extract the pickle file.

To launch the Pyhton Flask server run pytnon server.py inside the backend folder.

In the frontend folder run npm install && npm start.

Once our localhost:3000/ server is running you will see our application. You can play around with the different input fields to get an estimation of insurance charges from the entered input data.
